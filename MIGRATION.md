# Migration Strategy: PyQt6 to React + FastAPI + PyWebView

This document outlines the migration strategy for converting the original PyQt6 desktop application to a modern web-based architecture while maintaining desktop experience using PyWebView.

## Architecture Overview

### Original Architecture
- **Frontend**: PyQt6 for UI components and interactions
- **Backend**: Python business logic tightly coupled with UI
- **Database**: SQLAlchemy ORM with SQLite

### New Architecture
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, utilizing component-based approach
- **Backend**: FastAPI providing REST endpoints
- **Integration**: PyWebView to embed web UI in a desktop window
- **Database**: Maintained SQLAlchemy ORM with SQLite (unchanged)

## Key Components Mapping

### UI Components
| PyQt6 Component | React Equivalent |
|-----------------|------------------|
| QMainWindow | App.tsx |
| QTabWidget | React Router with tab-like navigation |
| QTableWidget | Custom table components with React |
| QLineEdit | Styled input components |
| QComboBox | Select components |
| QCheckBox | Checkbox components |
| QSlider | Custom RangeSlider component |
| QDialog | Modal components |
| QProgressBar | Progress indicators |

### Business Logic
| Original | New Approach |
|----------|--------------|
| Direct database access | API calls to FastAPI endpoints |
| PyQt signals/slots | React state and effects |
| Synchronous operations | Asynchronous operations with React Query |
| In-process parsing | Background tasks in FastAPI |

## Key Architectural Improvements

1. **Separation of Concerns**
   - UI logic is completely separated from business logic
   - Backend API can be independently scaled or replaced
   - Frontend can be developed independently

2. **Improved Performance**
   - Asynchronous API calls prevent UI blocking
   - React's virtual DOM for efficient UI updates
   - FastAPI's async capabilities for concurrent operations

3. **Enhanced Maintainability**
   - Component-based architecture for better code organization
   - TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience
   - Modern state management with React hooks and context

4. **Preserved Desktop Experience**
   - PyWebView provides native window experience
   - Access to local system resources through Python bridge
   - Familiar look and feel with matching UI/UX

## Migration Process

1. **Analysis Phase**
   - Identified core functionality and UI components
   - Mapped PyQt6 widgets to React components
   - Analyzed data flow and state management needs

2. **Backend Development**
   - Implemented FastAPI routes matching original functionality
   - Created Pydantic schemas for data validation
   - Maintained existing SQLAlchemy models
   - Added asynchronous capabilities to parsing module

3. **Frontend Development**
   - Built React components matching original UI layout
   - Implemented state management with Context API
   - Added theme support and styling
   - Created API service layer for communication with backend

4. **Integration**
   - Connected PyWebView to load React application
   - Established communication between Python and JavaScript
   - Ensured proper error handling between layers

## Parsing Module

The parsing module was one of the most complex parts of the migration:

1. **Original Implementation**
   - Synchronous parsing directly integrated with UI
   - UI freezing during long operations
   - Progress updates through Qt signals/slots

2. **New Implementation**
   - Background tasks in FastAPI
   - Progress tracking through API endpoints
   - React components polling for status updates
   - Cancelable operations
   - Improved error handling

## Future Enhancements

1. **WebSocket Integration**
   - Real-time updates for parsing progress
   - Live collaborative features

2. **Offline Support**
   - IndexedDB for local caching
   - Service workers for offline functionality

3. **Cloud Synchronization**
   - Optional cloud storage integration
   - Multi-device synchronization

4. **Mobile Compatibility**
   - Responsive design for mobile/tablet usage
   - Touch-friendly controls

## Conclusion

This migration successfully modernizes the application architecture while preserving the desktop experience and all existing functionality. The new architecture provides better scalability, maintainability, and sets a foundation for future enhancements.
